# Contributing

Thanks for contributing.

## Workflow

1. Create a branch from `main`.
2. Keep changes focused and small.
3. Update `SKILL.md` and references consistently.
4. Run local validation before opening a PR.

## Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] Scope and intent are documented
- [ ] EARS rules remain testable and explicit
- [ ] References are still valid and linked
- [ ] `pwsh ./scripts/validate.ps1` passes

## Commit Style

Use concise imperative messages, for example:

- `refine clarification question templates`
- `add measurable thresholds to EARS examples`
